### **Topic 1: Firewalls**

#### **Definition and Context**

-   **Firewall**: A hardware or software system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predefined security rules, acting as a barrier between a trusted internal network and untrusted external networks (e.g., the Internet).
-   **Context**: Firewalls are critical for network endpoint security, providing a single choke point to enforce security policies, protect against external attacks, and monitor network activity.

#### **Firewall Characteristics**

-   **Single Choke Point**: All traffic must pass through the firewall, achieved by physically blocking other access paths.
    -   Example: A firewall at the network perimeter ensuring all Internet traffic is filtered.
-   **Policy Enforcement**: Only authorized traffic, as defined by security policies, is allowed to pass.
    -   Example: Allowing HTTP traffic (port 80) but blocking FTP (port 21).
-   **Immunity to Penetration**: The firewall itself is hardened with a secure operating system to resist attacks.
    -   Example: Using a Linux-based firewall with minimal open ports.

#### **Firewall Techniques for Access Control**

Firewalls use four main techniques to enforce security policies:

1. **Service Control**:
    - Filters traffic based on service type, IP address, protocol, or port number, or hosts proxy services.
    - Example: Blocking Telnet (port 23) to prevent remote access.
2. **Direction Control**:
    - Manages the direction of service requests (inbound or outbound).
    - Example: Allowing outbound web requests but blocking inbound SSH attempts.
3. **User Control**:
    - Restricts access based on user identity, often requiring authentication (e.g., via IPsec).
    - Example: Allowing only authenticated employees to access a VPN.
4. **Behavior Control**:
    - Regulates how services are used (e.g., filtering spam emails).
    - Example: Blocking email attachments with suspicious extensions.

#### **Capabilities of Firewalls**

-   **Choke Point**: Simplifies security management by consolidating controls.
    -   Example: Centralizing traffic filtering at a single firewall.
-   **Monitoring Platform**: Supports audits and alarms for security events.
    -   Example: Logging failed login attempts for analysis.
-   **Non-Security Functions**: Includes network address translation (NAT) or usage logging.
    -   Example: Mapping private IP addresses to public ones via NAT.
-   **VPN Support**: Facilitates secure virtual private networks.
    -   Example: Hosting IPsec tunnels for remote access.

#### **Limitations**

-   **Bypass Attacks**: Cannot protect against attacks bypassing the firewall (e.g., dial-in modems).
-   **Internal Threats**: Limited protection against insider attacks.
-   **Wireless Vulnerabilities**: May not guard against unsecured wireless communications.
-   **Infected Devices**: Cannot prevent threats from devices infected outside the network (e.g., laptops).

#### **Types of Firewalls**

1. **Packet Filtering Firewall**:
    - Filters packets based on header information (e.g., source/destination IP, port, protocol).
    - **Example**: Blocking traffic from a malicious IP address.
    - **Advantages**: Simple, fast, transparent to users.
    - **Disadvantages**: No application-layer inspection, limited logging, vulnerable to spoofing.
2. **Stateful Inspection Firewall**:
    - Tracks connection states, allowing packets only for established connections.
    - **Example**: Permitting replies to outbound HTTP requests.
    - **Advantages**: More secure than packet filtering, tracks TCP states.
    - **Disadvantages**: Higher resource usage, still limited application-layer insight.
3. **Application-Level Gateway (Proxy Firewall)**:
    - Relays application-specific traffic, inspecting content at the application layer.
    - **Example**: A proxy verifying FTP commands before forwarding.
    - **Advantages**: High security, detailed logging, application-specific controls.
    - **Disadvantages**: Processing overhead, limited to supported applications.
4. **Circuit-Level Gateway**:
    - Creates two TCP connections without inspecting content, suitable for trusted internal users.
    - **Example**: Relaying outbound connections without content analysis.
    - **Advantages**: Low overhead, supports multiple protocols.
    - **Disadvantages**: Less granular control, no application-layer inspection.

#### **DMZ Networks**

-   **Definition**: A Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) is a network segment between internal and external firewalls, hosting externally accessible systems.
-   **Systems in DMZ**: Web servers, email servers, DNS servers, proxy servers.
-   **Purpose**: Provides controlled access to public services while protecting internal networks.
-   **Example**: A web server in the DMZ accessible via the Internet but isolated from internal servers.

#### **Key Differences: Packet Filtering vs. Stateful Inspection Firewalls**

| **Aspect**     | **Packet Filtering Firewall**           | **Stateful Inspection Firewall**                  |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **Inspection** | Individual packets (header only)        | Connection state and packet headers               |
| **Context**    | No memory of prior packets              | Maintains state table for connections             |
| **Security**   | Less secure, allows high-numbered ports | More secure, restricts to established connections |
| **Example**    | Blocking IP-based traffic               | Allowing TCP replies for outbound requests        |

#### **Importance**

-   **Threat Mitigation**: Protects endpoints from external attacks (e.g., hacking, malware).

### **Topic 4: Distributed Denial of Service Attacks**

#### **Definition and Context**

-   **Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attack**: A coordinated attack from multiple compromised devices (e.g., a botnet) aimed at overwhelming servers, networks, or end-user systems with excessive traffic to disrupt legitimate access to services.
-   **Denial of Service (DoS) Attack**: A similar attack from a single source, less complex than DDoS but with similar goals.
-   **Context**: DDoS attacks target endpoint availability, impacting businesses, websites, and critical infrastructure by rendering services inaccessible.

#### **Purpose and Impact**

-   **Purpose**: Prevent legitimate users from accessing services, causing disruption, financial loss, or reputational damage.
-   **Impact**:
    -   **Service Unavailability**: Websites, applications, or networks become slow or unreachable.
        -   Example: A retail website crashing during a sale due to DDoS traffic.
    -   **Economic Loss**: Downtime leads to lost revenue or recovery costs.
    -   **Reputation Damage**: Users lose trust in affected services.
    -   **Resource Exhaustion**: Consumes bandwidth, CPU, or memory, straining infrastructure.

#### **How DDoS Attacks Work**

-   **Mechanism**: Attackers use compromised devices (bots) to flood a target with useless traffic, exploiting vulnerabilities or overwhelming capacity.
-   **Common Techniques**:
    -   **Volumetric Attacks**: Saturate network bandwidth with high traffic volumes.
        -   Example: UDP flood sending massive data packets to exhaust bandwidth.
    -   **Protocol Attacks**: Exploit protocol weaknesses to consume server resources.
        -   Example: SYN flood sending incomplete TCP connection requests to tie up server ports.
    -   **Application-Layer Attacks**: Target specific applications with legitimate-looking requests.
        -   Example: HTTP flood overwhelming a web server with GET requests.
-   **Botnets**: Networks of infected devices controlled remotely to launch coordinated attacks.
    -   Example: Mirai botnet targeting IoT devices for large-scale DDoS attacks.

#### **DDoS Attack Characteristics**

-   **Distributed Nature**: Involves multiple sources, making it harder to block than a single-source DoS.
-   **Scale**: Can generate terabytes of traffic per second, overwhelming even robust systems.
-   **Anonymity**: Attackers hide behind compromised devices, complicating traceback.
-   **Persistence**: Attacks may last hours or days, requiring sustained defenses.

#### **Defense Strategies**

The notes emphasize proactive and reactive measures to mitigate DDoS attacks, focusing on endpoint and network protection:

1. **Prevention**:

    - **Traffic Filtering**: Use firewalls or intrusion prevention systems (IPS) to block malicious traffic.
        - Example: Configuring a firewall to drop UDP flood packets.
    - **Rate Limiting**: Restrict request rates to prevent resource exhaustion.
        - Example: Limiting HTTP requests per IP on a web server.
    - **Redundancy**: Deploy load balancers or multiple servers to distribute traffic.
        - Example: Using a content delivery network (CDN) to absorb traffic spikes.
    - **Patching**: Fix vulnerabilities exploited by DDoS (e.g., protocol flaws).
        - Example: Updating server software to mitigate SYN flood risks.

2. **Detection**:

    - **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)**: Monitor for abnormal traffic patterns.
        - Example: Detecting a sudden surge in SYN packets indicating a flood.
    - **Network Monitoring**: Analyze traffic to identify DDoS signatures.
        - Example: Using tools like NetFlow to spot volumetric attacks.
    - **Anomaly Detection**: Flag deviations from normal traffic behavior.
        - Example: Alerting on excessive requests from a single IP range.

3. **Response**:

    - **Traffic Diversion**: Route malicious traffic to mitigation services (e.g., cloud-based scrubbing centers).
        - Example: Redirecting DDoS traffic to a CDN like Cloudflare.
    - **Blackholing**: Drop traffic to the targeted IP to protect other services.
        - Example: Sacrificing a single server’s IP to save the network.
    - **Collaboration with ISPs**: Work with upstream providers to filter attack traffic.
        - Example: Requesting ISP-level blocking of botnet IPs.
    - **Incident Management**: Contain and recover from the attack, updating defenses.
        - Example: Restoring services after mitigating a DDoS with a scrubbing service.

4. **Post-Attack Analysis**:
    - **Forensics**: Analyze attack data to identify sources and improve defenses.
        - Example: Tracing botnet IPs to update blocklists.
    - **Policy Updates**: Strengthen security policies based on lessons learned.
        - Example: Enhancing rate-limiting rules after an HTTP flood.

#### **DDoS Defense Tools**

-   **Firewalls/IPS**: Block malicious traffic based on signatures or behavior.
-   **CDNs**: Distribute traffic to mitigate volumetric attacks.
-   **Load Balancers**: Spread legitimate traffic across servers.
