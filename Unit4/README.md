### **Topic 1: Wireless Security**

#### **Definition and Context**

-   **Wireless Security**: The practice of protecting wireless networks and their devices from unauthorized access, eavesdropping, and attacks, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
-   **Context**: Wireless networks, such as Wi-Fi, use broadcast communication, making them more vulnerable than wired networks. Security measures address these risks to protect data and services.

#### **Key Factors Increasing Wireless Security Risks**

-   **Channel**:
    -   Wireless networks transmit data via radio waves, enabling eavesdropping or jamming without physical access.
    -   Example: An attacker intercepting Wi-Fi signals in a public café.
-   **Mobility**:
    -   Wireless devices (e.g., laptops, smartphones) are portable, increasing risks of theft, loss, or unauthorized use.
    -   Example: A stolen tablet exposing corporate data.
-   **Resources**:
    -   Devices like smartphones have limited processing power, memory, or battery, constraining security measures (e.g., complex encryption).
    -   Example: A smartwatch unable to run advanced antivirus software.
-   **Accessibility**:
    -   Devices like sensors or IoT gadgets may be unattended in remote/hostile locations, vulnerable to physical tampering.
    -   Example: A weather sensor in a field being hacked.

#### **Wireless Network Threats**

-   **Accidental Association**: Devices unintentionally connect to nearby networks, exposing data.
    -   Example: A laptop connecting to a neighbor’s unsecured Wi-Fi.
-   **Malicious Association**: Attackers create fake access points (APs) to steal credentials.
    -   Example: A rogue AP mimicking a coffee shop’s Wi-Fi to capture passwords.
-   **Ad Hoc Networks**: Peer-to-peer wireless connections without central control, prone to attacks.
    -   Example: Two laptops in ad hoc mode sharing files without authentication.
-   **Nontraditional Networks**: Devices like Bluetooth or PDAs risk eavesdropping or spoofing.
    -   Example: A Bluetooth headset leaking audio data.
-   **Identity Theft (MAC Spoofing)**: Attackers mimic a legitimate device’s MAC address.
    -   Example: Spoofing an authorized MAC to bypass AP restrictions.
-   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks**: Interception and alteration of communications.
    -   Example: Intercepting Wi-Fi traffic to modify banking transactions.
-   **Denial of Service (DoS)**: Overwhelming network resources to disrupt access.
    -   Example: Flooding an AP with requests to disconnect users.
-   **Network Injection**: Injecting malicious packets into unfiltered traffic.
    -   Example: Sending fake routing messages to disrupt network operations.

#### **Wireless Security Measures**

-   **Securing Wireless Transmissions**:
    -   **Signal-Hiding Techniques**: Reduce signal leakage (e.g., directional antennas, lowering transmit power).
    -   **Encryption**: Protect data confidentiality (e.g., WPA3 encryption for Wi-Fi).
    -   Example: Using AES in WPA3 to secure data over a public Wi-Fi network.
-   **Securing Wireless Access Points**:
    -   **IEEE 802.1X**: Port-based authentication to control AP access.
    -   Example: Requiring user credentials before connecting to a corporate AP.
-   **Securing Wireless Networks**:
    -   **Use Encryption**: Implement strong protocols like WPA3.
    -   **Antivirus/Antispyware**: Protect devices from malware.
    -   **Turn Off Identifier Broadcasting**: Hide SSID to reduce visibility.
    -   **Change Default Settings**: Update default AP identifiers and passwords.
    -   **Restrict Access**: Allow only specific devices (e.g., MAC filtering).
    -   Example: Disabling SSID broadcast and using WPA3 on a home Wi-Fi network.

#### **Components Vulnerable to Attacks**

-   **Endpoint**: Devices like laptops or smartphones connecting to the network.
-   **Wireless Medium**: The radio frequency channel used for communication.
-   **Access Point (AP)**: The device bridging wireless and wired networks.
